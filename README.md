MathPlot
========

Mathematical function plotter in 3D spce using Analitza library 

Features:-
-----------
1) It can plot any function in cartesian co-ordinate system , supported by Analitza library.                                 
2) User can add or remove the plots according to the wish.                                            
3) User can hide some unwanted plots and after some time when he wants , he can also restore the hidden plots also.      
4) User can replace the equation with the other equation of the plot using change equation option.                        
5) Feature of random color will diffferentiate the functions based on the colors of the plot in the 3D space.
